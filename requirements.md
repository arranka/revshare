# RevShare Requirements

## Overview

A web application used by affiliate marketers to house the top revenue sharing programs (Traffic Monsoon, My Advertising Pays etc) with their affiliate links. 
This allows the user to promote RevShare and have their leads go through each of the revenue sharing programs in one easy place. From then on the leads then have the incentive of using RevShare as well
to promote their affiliate links. 

If the user does not provide an affiliate link for a particular rev sharing program then a default will be used which is ours.
